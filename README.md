burrito-fillings
================

burrito-fillings (canonically pronounced *boar-ee-toe phil-ings*; python package name ``bfillings``) contains [burrito](https://github.com/biocore/burrito) [CommandLineApplication](https://github.com/biocore/burrito/blob/master/burrito/util.py#L161) subclasses (i.e., *application controllers*) for bioinformatics applications. This is intended to be a temporary package for the application controllers that are used in QIIME as we figure out which of these we will continue to support.

**Note:** burrito fillings is currently under active development and its API is not stable. Major compatibility-breaking API changes will likely happen as development progresses.
